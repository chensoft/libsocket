-) the capability of sending raw packet

-) implement unix domain socket only under Unix

-) add socket opt support, such as tcp reuse address

-) get socket mtu after connected

-) add connecting state

-) tcp client reconnect using stored address and port

-) parse [fe80::1%lo0] v6 address with scope, store scope id to address_v6

-) enum network interfaces, mac addresses, ip addresses and so on

-) socket can accept or connect on specific interface according to its name

-) socket support queued data or msg, queued data will be sent after connect success

-) support read, read some, read all, read until separator occur

-) client connect to server via specific port, it's an advance tool

-) store connected host and ip address

-) if multiple ip addresses exist when query dns, socket can polling to connect to a valid address

-) timeout when user connect in but no send any data

-) anti slow packet attack

-) use chen::ip_address in socket methods

-) rename so::socket to basic

-) advance dns query(sync and async) methods

-) split host add port in so::endpoint?

-) accept "host:port" as param name addr when connect, ipv6 is "[fe80::1%lo0]:53"

-) specify query v4 or v6 dns only when specify host in connect

-) accept address_vx, port when connect

-) accept host, port when connect

-) allow query protocol port, use ":http" like string to connect

-) use std::future if make an async dns query

-) create udp conn like tcp conn, udp conn from the origin udp's same socket fd

-) using mutex to serialize read and write in udp and tcp

-) allow udp connect to a fixed address

-) report error if udp already connect to a fixed addr but still send to another address

-) how to add epoll, kqueue?
