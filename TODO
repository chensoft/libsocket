-) specify query v4 or v6 dns only when specify host in connect

-) if multiple ip addresses exist when query dns, socket can polling to connect to a valid address

-) listen on AF_INET6 support both v6 and v4, modern os support it

-) use AF_INET instead of chen::ip::address::Type::IPv4 in tcp client, server

-) allow kqueue, epoll poll multiple events when call the poll method

-) net socket's onXXX support pass void* as user's tag

-) server, client support usage stat, like received packets, bytes, current connections

-) dns IDN convert, rfc3490, punycode

-) the capability of sending raw packet

-) implement unix domain socket only under Unix

-) socket can accept or connect on specific interface according to its name

-) client connect to server via specific port, it's an advance tool

-) client use specific port and address, if host have multiple NICs, but want use specific NIC

-) timeout when user connect in but no send any data

-) allow udp connect to a fixed address

-) if udp is connected to a address, then send and recv only allow this address's packets

-) report error if udp already connect to a fixed addr but still send to another address

-) allow multicast and broadcast on socket

-) deadline is not same as timeout, add deadline support for socket

-) support set max connections limit in tcp, udp server socket

-) why use edge trigger, when user connect to server, only first read event received

-) add sendfile, TransmitFile, use method name: transmit
